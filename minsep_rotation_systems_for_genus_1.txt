GRAPH NUMBER: 1

Number of Vertices: 1
Number of Edges: 1
Edge set: [(0, 0)]

Total number of rotation systems on this graph that correspond to a minimal separating embedding of a surface of genus <=1: 1

Each of those 1 minimal separating rotation system has a minimum genus, minGenus, for which it is minimally separating. This minimum genus is computed as (E-V+n)/2 - 1, where n is the number of boundary components of the corresponding reduced band decomposition.

Iterating over all rotation systems that are minimally separating for genus g <= 1 we find that the smallest value minGenus takes is 0.

Iterating over all rotation systems that are minimally separating for genus g <= 1 we find that the largest value minGenus takes is 0.

The details of all 1 rotations systems on this graph that correspond to minimal separating embeddings in genus g <= 1 are shown below.
